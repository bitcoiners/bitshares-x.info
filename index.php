                <h2>A New Kind of Exchange</h2>
                    <p>
                    BitShares X is an experimental new type of decentralized exchange that will allow for trading derivative assets (like BitGold) that track the value of real-world assets (like Gold) without requiring a trusted price feed. This is done with a prediction-market-like mechanic which rewards traders who push the price towards consensus.

<h2>BitShares X: Trustless Price Stability</h2>

<p class="indented">BitShares X can create BitAssets by lending the asset into existence while backed by collateral in the same way that the banking system lends dollars into existence. Where your bank uses your house as collateral, BitShares X uses BTSX as collateral. These BitAssets use a market peg to track real world prices in a way much like a prediction market. For example, once the market has reached a consensus on the value of BitUSD, no one will be able to trade against that consensus without losing money. Thus the value of BitUSD today is based upon the prediction of what market participants value BitUSD at in the future. There will be only one rational way to speculate, that the consensus will hold, and this creates a reinforcing market peg.</p>

<p class="indented">All of this is done with a business model similar to traditional banks and exchanges. Bitshares X will have all the functionality of Bitcoin and existing decentralized asset exchanges and then some. Mining to provide network security has been eliminated in favor of Delegated Proof of Stake. With traditional proof-of-work, like in Bitcoin, miners currently impose 10% inflation per annum to the BTC supply, while creating centralizing incentives to due the economies of scale of mining. DPOS not only removes inflation but destroys income from transaction and trading fees to cause the supply to shrink and make each invidual share worth more. It does all this while having blockchain that is arguably more secure with a small fraction of the cost.

<h3>The Opportunity</h3>

<p class="indented">Given the current global financial instability, geopolitical tensions and extreme levels of government debt, holding sizable deposits of fiat is becoming increasingly risky. Therefore, BitShares X may need very little real-world proving under its belt before it is seen by some very big players as an appealing hedge for a portion of their portfolio.</p>

<p class="indented">Should these centralized risk factors become worse - such as significant deposit confiscations - BitShares X will be in a dominant position to displace a large part of a multi-trillion dollar industry virtually overnight.</p>

<h3>Existing Hotspots</h3>

<p class="indented">Places like Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina, Ghana and many Asian countries have significant capital controls that already restrict the flow of capital and foreign currency. The need for BitShares X to fill a void caused by these restrictions is clear, so it makes sense that there may be rapid adoption in areas like this, as they were also home to some of the strongest initial Bitcoin adoption.</p>


<h3>Future users of Bitshares X</h3>

<h4>Traders</h4>

<p class="indented">It should go without saying that the privacy, low costs, freedom from confiscation and other advantages of trading on a decentralized blockchain will appeal to many of the hundreds of thousands of traders currently engaged in trading currencies, commodities and stocks around the world.</p>

<p class="indented">In order to support such trading activities, BitShares X introduces Transfer Invisibly To Any Name or TITAN - A brand new privacy feature which allows for fully secure anonymous transactions, utilizing easy to remember user-created account names.</p>

<h4>Bitcoin Retailers and Users</h4>

<p class="indented">There are over 30,000 retailers who currently accept Bitcoin as payment; however the vast majority, due to tight retail margins and the relatively high volatility of Bitcoin, transition directly back to fiat via a third party service like BitPay. Many of these retailers may wish to hold a portion of their revenue in Bit-Assets such as BitUSD. Indeed it seems likely that third party services might form catering to retailers wishing to hold revenue in USD without the pains of buying back into USD.</p>

<p class="indented">Similarly the thousands of Bitcoin and alt-coin holders may also wish to hold a portion of their fiat earnings or savings in less volatile assets such as BitUSD, BitCNY or BitGold.</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>There is no real Gold backing BitGold. So how does it have value ?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">BitAssets can track the price of any commodity with enough market participants. BitGold, like any BitAsset, will require market participants predicting the consensus price to both rise and fall. If everyone expects BitGold to rise, then market participants will buy and push the price up until there are participants willing to short. When there are participants on both sides, then the asset has achieved a market peg which will create BitGold. In this way a commodity or currency will achieve a market consensus price which will mimic the price in the real world.</p>

<div class="item">
                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>What kind of asset can be market-pegged ?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">Any asset for which there is distributed consensus about its "true" price and sufficient market depth on the internal exchange can be tracked. The market will not allow new short positions and will not excute any margin calls below a certain market depth.</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How does BitShares X increase value for stakeholders ?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">Profits are realized from 4 different sources of <a href="http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Bitshares_X#Transaction_Fees">fees</a>. Where a normal corporation might pay dividends during a profitable time period, BitShares X uses blockchain technology to destroy shares. SO instead of each shareholder gaining more shares, the overall share supply is reduced. Mathematically the result is the same, with each shareholder growing their portion equally in relation to everyone else.  This may seem confusing at first, but a wallet will be released which shows the share increase in numbers readily understandable.</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>What is the difference in BTSX vs. BitAssets ?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">BTSX are like shares in the Bitshares X "Bank and Exchange". BitAssets are created inside the BitShares X DAC. BitAssets are priced in BTSX.  BitAssets rely on BTSX for pricing by the <a href="http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Market_Peg">market peg</a>. The currency of the BitShares X market will be shares in Bitshares X.  So BitAssets can not exist without being backed by BTSX.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Buying BTSX is much like using Bitcoin and requires the downloading of a wallet. Once released the official wallet will be available at <a href="http://www.dacsunlimited.com">Dacs Unlimited</a>. Once a wallet has been downloaded, the next step is to purchase BTSX from an exchange. As of July 2014 the two exchanges supporting BTSX are bter.com and btc38.com. Once the shares have been purchased, they need to be transferred to your BitShares X wallet where they can be used.</p>
